# Special Tic Tac Toe
Special Tic Tac Toe is a unique take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, combining elements of Tic Tac Toe and Checkers. It’s played on an 8x8 grid, where players must strategically "capture" their opponent's pieces with each move. The game is multiplayer and includes features like saving and loading game status, offering a smooth and continuous gaming experience.

## Gameplay

Board: The game is played on an 8x8 grid.

Objective: Each player must take turns capturing an opponent’s piece. At the end, whoever has the most pieces is declared the winner. The game’s twist lies in the requirement that each move must capture an opponent’s piece.

Turn skipping: If a player is unable to make a move (i.e., they have no valid captures), they must skip their turn.

Capture Mechanics: Similar to Checkers, pieces are captured by jumping over the opponent's pieces.
